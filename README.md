Group Project - BandWagon

Deployed site: https://susan2k83.github.io/bandwagon-1/

Requirements included building an app using data from 2 APIs.  We chose Wikipedia and SoudCloud.  We also needed to use a technology not yet presented in our boot camp, so we used Skeleton for buttons and font.  Bootstrap is still the main framework (grid system, navbar & jumbotrons).  Polished front end?  Check!  Error checking / input validation?  It's pretty robust.  Good coding standards: indentation, scoping, naming.  I think we're good there.  No pop-up "alerts", "prompts", or confirms.  Check out our modals!  We're mobile responsive, too.

The general concept of the app is that users can select a musical band or artist and view related facts and listen to SoundCloud tracks.

We use Firebase to store up to 5 initial presets.  From there, session users can add bands/artists which are added to the navbar buttons, overwriting presets just for their session.  Original pre-sets are refreshed on page load.

Future functionality could be to tie into Spotify (our first choice) so that we can access a larger collection of tracks and display complete discographies of each band or artist.  We could also use Amazon and create "Buy Now" links for track / album purchases.

Another idea that was suggested is to have the presets loaded with trending artists so that users can listen to hot tracks immediately.
